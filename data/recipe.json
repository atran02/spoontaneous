    "description": "this is a very traditional dish from yemen and is made with oxtail - hence it's name 'akwa (this is the yemeni word for oxtail or literally \"the thickest part of the tail\". it has one of the lengthiest cooking times i've encountered, but really is worth the wait (& you can get on with your chores whilst it's cooking as it needs little attention). i have a feeling that this could also be tweaked a little to accommodate crock pot cooking!  'akwa is also commonly eaten during the month of ramadan.",

    "description": "a crock pot version of 13 bean soup.  super easy & super yummy!  i buy the 13 bean soup mix in the bulk section of my supermarket.  it contains the 13 varieties of dry beans as follows:  baby limas, large limas, garbanzo, great northern, black-eyed peas, navy, black, red pinto, red lentils, green lentils, yellow splits, green splits,  and kidney beans.  even my toddler had fun eating this soup.  it was almost like watching a kid sort their m&m candies into colors!  we took the opportunity to teach her the name of each bean as she picked it out to eat.  be sure to plan ahead, as the beans need to soak overnight or for 8 hours before cooking.  (cook time noted includes soaking time.)  *update december 2011:  since hosting the january 2011 soupfest tag game in the topic of the month forum i have been using sharon123's recipe for homemade herb & garlic broth (link in ingredients section) instead of just plain water as the soup base.  it's absolutely delicious and so easy to make and store in the freezer.  feel free to use that recipe or any other broth for some or all of the water in the soup (not for soaking the beans).",

    "description": "i recently tried a russian honey cake, which was one of the yummiest cakes i have ever tasted. it was so nice i decided to find the recipe and learn to make it myself. it took me about 6 months searching the net (on websites mostly in russian, which i definitely don't read or speak) translating from russian using an online translator, and trying different recipes before i found this recipe, which has produced a result at least as nice as the one i tried.\n\ni baked 2 pieces at a time on baking paper on an oven tray. each batch took just long enough to cook, that i had two more ready to swap when the first ones were done.\n\nthe cream filling (and coating) is made from sour cream and sugar. the sour cream is simply whipped with the sugar until the sugar dissolves. the original recipe said to add sugar \"by intuition\"; i think you're supposed to keep adding more until it thickens, but the time i tried that it was too sickly sweet!\n\ni have also made the filling/coating using fresh cream - 750ml, soured with 1/2 cup lemon juice and beaten until just starting to thicken (you still use the sugar & honey). this was for a vegetarian who pointed out that the cultured sour cream i used had gelatin in it. a slightly different taste, but a very nice variation.\n\ni personally don't like walnuts all that much, so i leave them out whenever i cook this.",
